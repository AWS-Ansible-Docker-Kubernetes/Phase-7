### Security

Refer: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud provides features that you can use to increase and monitor the security for your virtual private cloud (VPC):

* **Security groups** — Act as a firewall for associated Amazon EC2 instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level

* **Network access control lists (ACLs)** — Act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level

* **Flow logs** — Capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC
