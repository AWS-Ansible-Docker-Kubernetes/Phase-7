### Amazon VPC

Refer: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html

* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. 

* This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

* Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon EC2. 

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.

* It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. 

* You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. 

* You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, associate security groups, and configure route tables.

### Subnets:

* A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet.

* Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet.

* Use a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet.

* To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists (ACL).
